        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss" style="margin-top:50px">The litmus test for any organization is the impact it has on the ground. At the International Trade Centre, measuring the results of our work is a permanent preoccupation. It is an essential part of ensuring that we continuously improve at delivering as much as we can, and providing the best possible value for money, to our partners and clients.</p>
        
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">As important as quantitative assessments of our interventions are, qualitative accounts serve a valuable function. They illustrate how our projects empower firms to connect to markets, help public agencies get better at supporting would-be exporters, and contribute to smarter trade-related policymaking both at home and at the multilateral level, such as at the World Trade Organization. Most importantly, they show us how our work leads to lasting improvements in people’s lives, in the shape of better jobs, a safer environment, more sustainable businesses, and enhanced opportunities for women and youth in particular.</p>
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Through these 14 case stories from across the spectrum of ITC’s work, this small publication seeks to make tangible the connections between global development goals or international trade policy discussions and the day-to-day realities of individual people and companies in developing countries.</p>
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">As a 100% Aid for Trade organization, ITC functions as a bridge between the trade opportunities created at the WTO or in regional and bilateral agreements, the collective developmental aspirations embodied in the United Nations, and small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states, small economies, and fragile states.</p>
        
        <img src="IMG_8676_opt.jpeg" alt="IMG_8676.JPG" style="width:100%"/>
        
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">In these stories, you will read about businesses, as well as the people behind them, and the challenges they faced. You will hear about a Moroccan exporter who used ITC market intelligence tools to discover new potential customers, and an Ivoirian cocoa trader whose export clearance times plunged after he used a new mechanism that the government set up after an ITC survey of non-tariff measures. You will meet Marey Yogiyo, a coffee farmer from Papua New Guinea, who with ITC’s help became her country’s first woman with a coffee export licence, and is now selling coffee to a major multinational at a healthy premium to the domestic price. You will probably be surprised to learn about how getting halal certification helped an Egyptian dairy company break into new markets, from Azerbaijan to Indonesia.</p>
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">These stories represent just a small part of ITC’s portfolio. But they are representative of how ITC delivers trade impact for good. They provide insight into the dedication of ITC staff to ensure that our interventions are transformational, and lead to sustainable results. In addition, they bear testament to how much of our assistance is delivered together with partners in developing and least developed countries, whether governments, international organizations, trade support institutions, businesses or civil society groups. For ITC, partnerships are not just an essential force multiplier for what remains a compact agency, but a guarantee that expertise and capacity will be durably enhanced in the countries we work with.</p>
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">ITC was founded in recognition of the fact that market opening does not automatically enable companies or communities in developing countries to take advantage of new trade opportunities. Fifty years later, trade integration remains a vital driver of growth and sustainable development. Using regional and global markets to propel growth has enabled the greatest poverty reduction in history. Our collective challenge is to ensure that no country or community remains on the margins of the international marketplace.</p>
        <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">To ensure that we keep connecting people to markets as efficiently as possible, we have, over the past few years, built a more robust results-based management framework.  Our commitment is to continue to modernize and find innovative ways to capture and measure results. These stories are the beginning of what we anticipate will be greater communication of what we are achieving on the ground with your support and based on your demand. Consider this publication to be a window on what we can achieve together.</p>
