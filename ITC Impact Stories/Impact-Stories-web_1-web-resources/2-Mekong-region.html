            <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">A South-South trade promotion project by ITC and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) contributed to a sharp rise in trade between 14 African nations and three Mekong countries, recent trade data show.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Data provided by Viet Nam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade indicate that trade between the eight countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) and Viet Nam rose fivefold to US$935.2 million in 2013, compared with US$180 million in 2007.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Trade between the six countries of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and Viet Nam increased more than fourfold to US$309.5 million in 2012, compared with US$65 million in 2007.</p>

            <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Contracts that ITC has facilitated over the last six years have amounted to at least US$160 million in the cashew nut, rice and cotton sectors. ITC has also facilitated the transfer of cashew processing machinery from Viet Nam to Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Headline numbers may be just the start of a thriving South-South partnership. ITC’s trade flow analysis indicates the potential business partnership between the regions may be closer to US$5 billion.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">‘Businesses of Viet Nam and of the CEMAC and UEMOA countries participated actively in numerous activities organized by ITC and OIF,’ said Le Duong Quang, Viet Nam’s Vice-Minister of Industry and Trade. ‘The cooperation between Viet Nam and CEMAC and UEMOA is developing not just in trade, but also in investment.’</p>

            <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">‘Achievements in 2013 include the conclusion of technology transfer agreements in the cashew nut sector from Viet Nam to Burkina Faso, and the establishment of direct cooperation between banks in the two regions, which will significantly reduce transaction times and costs,’ said Ben Mohamed Imamo, Senior Programme Officer at ITC.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">OIF approached ITC in 2007 to set up a project to expand intra- and inter-regional trade between CEMAC, UEMOA and the three francophone countries of the Mekong region – Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. The project began in 2008 and concluded with an agribusiness forum in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, in January 2014 and an interbank partnership meeting in June 2014.</p>
			<p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Based on surveys by ITC, stakeholders prioritized agribusiness, textiles and clothing, and wood as sectors with the highest potential. Cotton is an export product for eight of the 14 African countries that comprise the two regional economic communities, while Viet Nam is one of South-East Asia’s major exporters of wood furniture.</p>

            <p class="Text-Body-Swiss">Kinninnon said that one problem often encountered by exporters from both regions is that letters of credit have to be confirmed by a European bank, which causes delays and additional costs. As part of ITC’s methodology to promote South-South trade, it facilitated direct interbank cooperation between the Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade and banks in the Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau and Togo in 2013.</p>
